This is my first README.md file, I have no idea what that file extension is, but it seems to open just fine in VS Code so...
This is the README.md file for my odin-recipes project started 2/6/2022
It is designed to demonstrate my basic understanding of HTML and will require the following:
1. An index.html file with basic HTML boilerplate code
    <!DOCTYPE html>                      <!--this tells VS Code that this is an html file-->
        <html lang="en">                 <!--this tells VS COde that it is in english 
                                            for translation purposes-->
        <head>                           <!--this is where the head starts, a vital part 
                                            of the html code-->
            <title>odin-recipes,</title> <!--this is the title of the page, one of 
                                                two necessary parts of the head-->
            <meta charset="utf-8">       <!--this is letting VS Code that we are using 
                                            charset "utf-8"-->
        </head>                          <!-- this is where the head ends-->
        <body>                           <!--this is where the body begins-->
                                         <!--this is the body where all of the 
                                            viewable material, links, etc for our site goes-->
        </body>                          <!--this is where the body ends-->
    </html>
2. A pages directory where we will stor the html docs for the other pages of our site.
3. A pictures directory where we will store images for the site.
This will demonstrate my ability to:
     use the <p></p> function to separate text into paragraphs
     use the <h></h> function (1-6) to create headings for the page
     use the <em></em> and <strong></strong> functions to put emphasis on the text
     use the <a> href="protocol://domain/path"</a> anchor function to create absolute
        links outside of the site.
     use the <a> href="path" </a> function to create relative links inside our directory
     use the <ul> function to create unordered lists
     and the <ol> function to create ordered lists
4. It will also require me to do several commits to gitHub and I will become more familiar with this process
