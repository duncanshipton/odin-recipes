        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roasting a chicken is one of my favorite meals, it can feed a few people, can be paired with a lot of other dishes and tastes delicious, plus it's super easy!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Whole Chicken</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Tarragon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 365 Degrees Farenheit</li>
            <li>Place Chicken in a pyrex dish or other oven-safe cookware.</li>
            <li>Add spices: Coat in olive oil and add a light rub of salt and pepper finish with a heavy sprinkling of Tarragon</li>
            <li>Place in oven for 1 1/2 hours. Depending on the size and weight of the chicken this can be a little more, but is usually not less, to check if the chicken is done you can use a thermometer or cut into the thickest part of the breast or thigh to make sure there is no uncooked meat in there.</li>
            <li>Voila! You have amazing roast chicken for dinner. :)</li>
