                <li>One Chicken Casrcass</li>
                <li>Drippings from a roast chicken</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Make chicken stock from the carcass.</h4> 
                    <p> Bring a large pot of water to the boil, add to it the chicken carcass, half a lemon (juiced and then throw the rind in for good measure), any leaves from your celery, a bay leaf, 1 tablespoon of salt, and a few pinched of pepper. Bring to the boil and let simmer for three hours. Three hours is a long time, keep adding water so the pot doesn't run dry and so you don't inadvertantly burn the chicken carcass, set off your houses' fire alarm and cause much disgruntlement with your housemates. Strain the stock into a large bowl and keep the carcass. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Cook the Vegetables</h4>
                    <p> Melt at least 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet, chop the onion and add it to the butter to cook on "low". while the onion is cooking cut up 3 or 4 small to medium-sized carrots and 3 or 4 stalks of the celery. Add the Carrots next and celery last waiting a little time between each. Leave covered on "low" while you...</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h4>Strip the Carcass</h4>
                    <p>While the veggies are cooking: take the left over chicken carcass and extract all the possible little pieces of chicken meat left on the bones I find using two forks to be the most useful tools for this roughly chop the remaining meat into small pieces. Be careful to throw away all the bones, cartilage and any of the lemon peel of celery leaves that migh still be hanging around.</p>  </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h4>Season the Vegetabels</h4>
                    <p> To the veggies add: the chopped chicken meat, a tablespoon of tarragon, a couple of pinches of both salt and pepper, and one or two tablespoons of the fat that has settled on top of the drippings that you saved from the roast chicken. Sautee on low. </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h4>Finish the stock</h4>
                    <p> Bring the strained stock to the boil over high heat in a large pot. Add all the brown lower part of the settled drippings from the roast chicken to the pot, be careful not to add too much of the yellow fat that has settled at the top, a little bit is nice, but too much will make the soup greasy and disgusting. bring all to a rolling boil.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h4>Finish the Soup</h4>
                    <p> Mix the seasoned veggies into the stock and bring to the boil.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
